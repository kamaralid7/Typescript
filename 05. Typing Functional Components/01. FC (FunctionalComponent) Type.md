In TypeScript, when typing functional components in React, you can use `React.FC` (also written as `React.FunctionComponent`). It provides a built-in way to define the types for props and the component itself. However, while `React.FC` offers some conveniences, it also comes with a few limitations, leading some developers to avoid it. Let’s explore the pros and cons of using `React.FC` to help you decide whether to use it in your projects.

### Pros of Using `React.FC`

1. **Automatic Type Inference for `children`**:
   When you use `React.FC`, TypeScript automatically types the `children` prop, which is useful when your component expects `children`.

   ```tsx
   const MyComponent: React.FC = ({ children }) => {
     return <div>{children}</div>;
   };
   ```

   - In this case, the `children` prop is automatically inferred as `ReactNode`, which covers most of the JSX you would pass as `children`.

2. **Explicit Return Type**:
   `React.FC` automatically infers the return type as `ReactElement` (or `JSX.Element`), so you don’t need to specify it manually.

   ```tsx
   const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
     return <div>Hello</div>; // Return type is inferred as JSX.Element
   };
   ```

   This ensures that your functional component returns valid React elements, reducing the chance of accidentally returning invalid values.

3. **Enforces Functional Component Signature**:
   By using `React.FC`, TypeScript enforces the correct function signature for React components. It ensures the return value is valid JSX and the component has a proper props definition.

4. **Consistency**:
   Using `React.FC` provides a consistent pattern for declaring functional components, especially in codebases where the use of `children` is common.

### Cons of Using `React.FC`

1. **Optional `children` Prop**:
   The most common issue with `React.FC` is that it automatically includes the `children` prop, even if your component doesn’t use it. This can lead to confusion because `children` is implicitly defined as optional.

   ```tsx
   const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
     return <div>No children needed</div>;
   };

   // The component implicitly accepts `children`, even if it doesn't use it.
   <MyComponent>Some child content</MyComponent>;
   ```

   This can be problematic if you want to explicitly disallow `children` or don't want to allow extra props to be passed inadvertently.

   **Workaround**: You can manually exclude `children` using the `Omit` utility type:

   ```tsx
   const MyComponent: React.FC<Omit<{}, 'children'>> = () => {
     return <div>No children allowed</div>;
   };
   ```

2. **Inflexibility with Default Props**:
   `React.FC` doesn’t handle default props well with TypeScript’s type inference. Defining default props may require additional work, as TypeScript can sometimes misinterpret them.

   ```tsx
   interface Props {
     title?: string;
   }

   const MyComponent: React.FC<Props> = ({ title = "Default Title" }) => {
     return <div>{title}</div>;
   };

   // TypeScript might not correctly infer that `title` is optional
   ```

   Although you can set default props manually, `React.FC` does not have perfect type inference for them, and TypeScript might not fully understand that certain props are optional due to default values.

3. **Lack of Support for Generic Props**:
   `React.FC` can be restrictive when working with generic props. When you use generics in functional components, it’s better to avoid `React.FC` because its type inference may not handle them well.

   ```tsx
   // Generic Component without React.FC
   function MyComponent<T>({ value }: { value: T }) {
     return <div>{String(value)}</div>;
   }
   ```

   Generics are often more cumbersome to type correctly with `React.FC`, so most developers avoid it for these cases.

4. **No Explicit `return` Type Needed**:
   One of the conveniences of `React.FC` is that it automatically infers the return type as `ReactElement`, but this can also be achieved without `React.FC` by simply omitting the explicit return type and letting TypeScript infer it naturally.

   ```tsx
   const MyComponent = () => {
     return <div>Hello</div>; // TypeScript infers JSX.Element return type
   };
   ```

   This reduces the need to rely on `React.FC` solely for the purpose of having return type safety.

5. **Default Props and `React.FC` Conflict**:
   Another issue arises when combining default props and `React.FC`. TypeScript’s inference around default props and `React.FC` doesn't work perfectly, leading some developers to avoid `React.FC` to prevent confusion.

### Alternatives to `React.FC`

Instead of using `React.FC`, many developers prefer to type their functional components manually. Here's how you can define functional components without `React.FC`:

#### Typing Props Without `React.FC`:

```tsx
interface Props {
  title: string;
}

const MyComponent = ({ title }: Props) => {
  return <div>{title}</div>;
};
```

In this approach:
- You explicitly define the props interface (`Props`).
- You don’t include unnecessary `children` in the props unless you explicitly want it.
- TypeScript will still infer the return type as `JSX.Element` or `ReactElement`, ensuring type safety without requiring `React.FC`.

#### Typing Components with `children`:

If your component accepts `children`, you can define it manually without `React.FC`:

```tsx
interface Props {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

const MyComponent = ({ children }: Props) => {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
};
```

This approach gives you full control over whether `children` should be included or excluded in the props.

| Provides consistency in typing functional components | Doesn’t handle default props and generics well                                            |
| Inferred return type (`JSX.Element`)              | Extra verbosity (you can achieve the same with less code)                                |
| Enforces functional component structure           | Restrictive for more complex typing, like generic components                             |

### Conclusion

While `React.FC` provides some helpful features (like automatically typing `children` and enforcing component structure), it also comes with limitations, such as the automatic inclusion of `children`, issues with default props, and difficulties with generics. Many developers prefer to define their component types manually to avoid these issues, as it offers more flexibility and cleaner code in some cases. Ultimately, whether or not to use `React.FC` depends on your project’s specific needs and your preferences for typing functional components in TypeScript.
