### Array and Tuple Types in TypeScript

TypeScript offers static typing for arrays and tuples, allowing you to specify the types of elements contained within them. This provides enhanced type safety when working with collections of data.

---

## **1. Array Types**

An **array** is a collection of elements of the same type. In TypeScript, you can specify the type of the elements in an array to ensure that only values of that type are added.

### **Syntax for Array Types**

There are two ways to declare an array type in TypeScript:

1. **Type followed by square brackets**: `type[]`
2. **Generic array type**: `Array<type>`

### **Example: Number Array**

```typescript
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let moreNumbers: Array<number> = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
```

- Both `numbers` and `moreNumbers` are arrays of `number` elements.
- If you try to add a non-number element, TypeScript will raise an error.

### **Example: String Array**

```typescript
let fruits: string[] = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
let moreFruits: Array<string> = ["grape", "mango", "pineapple"];
```

- `fruits` and `moreFruits` are arrays that contain only `string` elements.

### **Multidimensional Arrays**

You can also define multidimensional arrays by adding more sets of square brackets.

#### Example:

```typescript
let matrix: number[][] = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
];
```

This creates a 2D array (array of arrays) where each inner array contains numbers.

---

## **2. Tuple Types**

A **tuple** is a typed array with a fixed length and types for each index. Tuples allow you to specify exactly what type of value will appear at each position in the array, and the number of elements is fixed.

### **Syntax for Tuple Types**

```typescript
let tuple: [type1, type2, type3];
```

### **Example: Basic Tuple**

```typescript
let person: [string, number] = ["Alice", 25];
```

- The `person` tuple has two elements: a `string` and a `number`.
- If you try to add an extra element or use incorrect types, TypeScript will raise an error.

#### Incorrect Tuple Assignment:

```typescript
// let person: [string, number] = [25, "Alice"]; // Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
```

### **Accessing Tuple Elements**

You can access tuple elements using array indexing, just like regular arrays.

#### Example:

```typescript
console.log(person[0]); // Output: Alice
console.log(person[1]); // Output: 25
```

### **Optional Tuple Elements**

You can make certain tuple elements optional using the `?` syntax.

#### Example:

```typescript
let person: [string, number?] = ["Alice"];
console.log(person[0]); // Output: Alice
console.log(person[1]); // Output: undefined
```

Here, the second element (`number`) is optional.

### **Heterogeneous Tuples**

Tuples can contain elements of different types.

#### Example:

```typescript
let book: [string, number, boolean] = ["The Great Gatsby", 1925, true];
```

- `book` is a tuple where the first element is a `string`, the second is a `number`, and the third is a `boolean`.

---

## **3. Tuple with Rest Elements**

In TypeScript, tuples can have a fixed number of elements followed by a rest element, which allows for flexibility with additional values.

### **Example: Tuple with Rest Element**

```typescript
let list: [number, ...string[]] = [1, "apple", "banana", "orange"];
```

- The first element of `list` is a `number`.
- The rest of the elements are strings (due to the `...string[]` rest element syntax).

---

## **4. Destructuring Arrays and Tuples**

You can use destructuring to easily extract values from arrays and tuples into individual variables.

### **Example: Array Destructuring**

```typescript
let fruits: string[] = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
let [firstFruit, secondFruit] = fruits;

console.log(firstFruit); // Output: apple
console.log(secondFruit); // Output: banana
```

### **Example: Tuple Destructuring**

```typescript
let person: [string, number] = ["Alice", 25];
let [name, age] = person;

console.log(name); // Output: Alice
console.log(age);  // Output: 25
```

---

## **5. Common Operations on Arrays and Tuples**

### **Pushing Elements to an Array**

You can add elements to an array using methods like `push()`.

```typescript
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.push(4);
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

However, tuples have a fixed length, so you can't add new elements beyond their defined length unless you have rest elements.

### **Accessing and Modifying Elements**

You can access and modify elements in arrays and tuples using index notation.

#### Example:

```typescript
let colors: string[] = ["red", "green", "blue"];
console.log(colors[1]); // Output: green

colors[1] = "yellow"; // Modifying the second element
console.log(colors);   // Output: ["red", "yellow", "blue"]
```

For tuples:

```typescript
let person: [string, number] = ["Alice", 25];
person[0] = "Bob";    // OK
person[1] = 30;       // OK
// person[2] = true;  // Error: Tuple type '[string, number]' of length '2' has no element at index '2'.
```

---

## **6. Type Inference in Arrays and Tuples**

TypeScript can infer the types of arrays and tuples based on their initial values.

### **Example: Inferred Array Type**

```typescript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3]; // Inferred as `number[]`
numbers.push(4);         // OK
// numbers.push("five"); // Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
```

### **Example: Inferred Tuple Type**

```typescript
let tuple = ["Alice", 25]; // Inferred as `[string, number]`
```

In this case, TypeScript infers the tuple type based on the values.

---

## **7. Comparison Between Arrays and Tuples**

### **Arrays**:
- Homogeneous collection (usually all elements are of the same type).
- Flexible size — you can add or remove elements freely.
- Useful when you need to store an unknown number of elements of the same type.

### **Tuples**:
- Fixed size — each element has a predefined type and position.
- Can store values of different types at different positions.
- Useful when you need to store a collection of fixed-size, structured data (e.g., coordinates, settings).

---

## **Summary**

- **Arrays**: Collections of elements of the same type. Use the `type[]` or `Array<type>` syntax to define them. Arrays can be multidimensional, and you can perform various operations like pushing or popping elements.
- **Tuples**: Arrays with a fixed number of elements, where each element can have a different type. They are useful when you need to work with structured, fixed-size data.
- You can use **destructuring** to easily access array or tuple elements.
- Arrays and tuples offer flexibility and type safety, ensuring you can only store and manipulate elements according to their defined types.

Both arrays and tuples play a crucial role in managing collections of data in TypeScript, and understanding their differences is essential for working with structured data effectively.
