### Type Inference in TypeScript

**Type inference** is a powerful feature in TypeScript that automatically infers the types of variables, parameters, and return values based on the context, without explicitly specifying the type. This helps make TypeScript code more concise while still maintaining type safety.

TypeScript will infer the type based on the value you assign to a variable, the value returned from a function, or the parameters passed to a function.

---

## **1. Basic Type Inference**

When you assign a value to a variable without explicitly specifying a type, TypeScript infers the type from the value.

### Example:

```typescript
let age = 30; // TypeScript infers `age` as `number`
let name = "Alice"; // TypeScript infers `name` as `string`
let isActive = true; // TypeScript infers `isActive` as `boolean`
```

In these examples:
- `age` is inferred as `number`.
- `name` is inferred as `string`.
- `isActive` is inferred as `boolean`.

---

## **2. Inference with Arrays**

When you assign an array, TypeScript infers the type of the array based on the elements.

### Example:

```typescript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]; // TypeScript infers `numbers` as `number[]`
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]; // TypeScript infers `fruits` as `string[]`
```

- `numbers` is inferred as `number[]` (array of numbers).
- `fruits` is inferred as `string[]` (array of strings).

---

## **3. Inference with Functions**

TypeScript can infer the return type of a function based on the `return` statement, without the need to explicitly define the return type.

### Example:

```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b; // TypeScript infers the return type as `number`
}

let result = add(5, 10); // `result` is inferred as `number`
```

In this case:
- The `add` function does not explicitly define its return type, but TypeScript infers it as `number` because `a + b` is a numeric operation.
- The variable `result` is also inferred as `number`.

---

## **4. Inference with Function Parameters**

TypeScript can infer the types of function parameters based on how they are used within the function. However, TypeScript does **not** infer types for function parameters unless explicitly specified or based on usage.

### Example:

```typescript
function multiply(a: number, b: number) {
  return a * b; // TypeScript infers return type as `number`
}

multiply(3, 5); // TypeScript ensures `a` and `b` are both numbers
```

Although TypeScript can infer the return type, itâ€™s a good practice to explicitly type function parameters for clarity and to avoid errors.

---

## **5. Best Common Type**

When an array contains elements of different types, TypeScript tries to infer the **best common type** that works for all the elements. This is typically the **union** of all the types.

### Example:

```typescript
let mixedArray = [1, "two", true]; // TypeScript infers `mixedArray` as `(string | number | boolean)[]`
```

In this case:
- TypeScript infers the type of `mixedArray` as `(string | number | boolean)[]`, since the array contains `string`, `number`, and `boolean` elements.

---

## **6. Contextual Typing**

**Contextual typing** occurs when TypeScript infers types based on the context in which a function or expression is used. This is especially common in callbacks, event handlers, and function arguments.

### Example:

```typescript
window.onmousedown = function(event) {
  console.log(event.button); // TypeScript infers `event` as `MouseEvent` and knows `button` is a valid property
};
```

Here:
- The `onmousedown` handler is used in the context of a mouse event, so TypeScript infers that `event` is a `MouseEvent` type, allowing access to mouse-specific properties like `button`.

---

## **7. Inference in Object Types**

TypeScript can infer object types based on the values provided to the object properties.

### Example:

```typescript
let person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
  isStudent: false,
};

person.name = "Bob"; // OK: `name` is inferred as `string`
person.age = 30; // OK: `age` is inferred as `number`
// person.isStudent = "yes"; // Error: `isStudent` is inferred as `boolean`, so assigning a string causes an error
```

- `person.name` is inferred as `string`.
- `person.age` is inferred as `number`.
- `person.isStudent` is inferred as `boolean`.

TypeScript uses the initial values to infer the types of the object properties, and it will throw errors if you try to assign values that don't match the inferred types.

---

## **8. Type Inference in Generics**

When using generic functions or classes, TypeScript can often infer the type of the generic parameter based on how the function is called.

### Example:

```typescript
function identity<T>(value: T): T {
  return value;
}

let num = identity(42); // TypeScript infers `T` as `number`
let str = identity("Hello"); // TypeScript infers `T` as `string`
```

In this case:
- When `identity` is called with a `number`, TypeScript infers that `T` is `number`.
- When `identity` is called with a `string`, TypeScript infers that `T` is `string`.

---

## **9. Inference with Union Types and Narrowing**

TypeScript uses **type narrowing** to infer more specific types based on conditional checks. It will narrow the type of a variable based on the checks performed in the code.

### Example:

```typescript
function printId(id: number | string) {
  if (typeof id === "string") {
    console.log(id.toUpperCase()); // TypeScript infers `id` as `string` inside this block
  } else {
    console.log(id); // TypeScript infers `id` as `number` inside this block
  }
}
```

Here, TypeScript infers the more specific types of `id` based on the `typeof` check.

---

## **10. Type Inference in Classes**

When working with classes, TypeScript can infer the types of properties based on how they are initialized in the constructor or within the class.

### Example:

```typescript
class Person {
  name = "Alice"; // Inferred as `string`
  age = 25; // Inferred as `number`

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}

let person = new Person();
person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice
```

In this example:
- TypeScript infers `name` as `string` and `age` as `number` based on the values assigned in the class.

---

## **11. Limiting Type Inference with `as const`**

You can force TypeScript to infer more specific types by using the `as const` assertion. This tells TypeScript to treat values as literal types rather than their general types.

### Example:

```typescript
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"] as const;
// TypeScript infers `colors` as a tuple: ["red", "green", "blue"] instead of `string[]`
```

In this case, the `as const` assertion forces TypeScript to treat the array as a tuple with literal types `"red"`, `"green"`, and `"blue"`, rather than a general `string[]`.

---

## **12. `const` vs. `let` and Type Inference**

TypeScript infers more specific types for `const` variables because their values are constant, whereas `let` variables can be reassigned.

### Example:

```typescript
const num = 10; // Inferred as `10` (literal type)
let num2 = 10; // Inferred as `number` (general type)
```

In this example:
- `const num` is inferred as the literal type `10`.
- `let num2` is inferred as the general type `number` because it can be reassigned.

---

## **Summary**

- **Type inference** allows TypeScript to automatically deduce the type of variables, parameters, and return values based on the context and initial values.
- **Basic inference**: TypeScript infers types of variables and function return types based on assigned values.
- **Best common type**: TypeScript determines a common type when working with arrays containing multiple types.
- **Contextual typing**: TypeScript infers types in callbacks or event handlers based on the surrounding context.
- **Type narrowing**: TypeScript infers more specific types based on conditional checks.
- **Generics**: TypeScript can infer the type of generic parameters based on how functions or classes are used.

While TypeScript does an excellent job of inferring types automatically, it's still a good practice to explicitly annotate types for function parameters and return types, especially in complex codebases. This improves code readability and ensures that types are clear and maintainable.
