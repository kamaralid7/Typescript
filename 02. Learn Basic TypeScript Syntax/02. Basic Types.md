### Basic Types in TypeScript

TypeScript introduces static typing to JavaScript by allowing developers to define types for variables, parameters, and return values. This helps catch errors at compile time and improves the robustness of your code. Let’s explore the **basic types** in TypeScript.

---

## **1. Number**

The `number` type is used to represent all types of numbers: integers, floats, and hex, binary, or octal values.

### Example:

```typescript
let age: number = 25;
let price: number = 9.99;
let hex: number = 0xf00d;
let binary: number = 0b1010;
let octal: number = 0o744;
```

---

## **2. String**

The `string` type represents textual data. You can use single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or template literals (`` ` ``) to define string values.

### Example:

```typescript
let name: string = "Alice";
let greeting: string = `Hello, ${name}!`;  // Template literal
```

---

## **3. Boolean**

The `boolean` type is used to represent a logical entity and can hold two values: `true` or `false`.

### Example:

```typescript
let isActive: boolean = true;
let hasError: boolean = false;
```

---

## **4. Array**

Arrays in TypeScript are defined to contain elements of a specific type. There are two syntaxes for defining arrays:

- **Array type**: `type[]`
- **Generic array type**: `Array<type>`

### Example:

```typescript
let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let fruits: Array<string> = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
```

---

## **5. Tuple**

Tuples are a special type in TypeScript that allow you to define an array with fixed types for each element.

### Example:

```typescript
let person: [string, number];
person = ["Alice", 30]; // OK
// person = [30, "Alice"]; // Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
```

Tuples are useful when you know exactly how many elements your array will have and what types each element will be.

---

## **6. Enum**

**Enums** (short for enumerations) allow you to define a set of named constants. Enums can be either numeric or string-based.

### Numeric Enum Example:

```typescript
enum Direction {
  Up = 1,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}

let direction: Direction = Direction.Up;
```

### String Enum Example:

```typescript
enum Direction {
  Up = "UP",
  Down = "DOWN",
  Left = "LEFT",
  Right = "RIGHT",
}

let direction: Direction = Direction.Left;
```

---

## **7. Any**

The `any` type allows a variable to hold any type of value. It disables type checking for that variable and can be useful when migrating old JavaScript code to TypeScript or when you are unsure of the type.

### Example:

```typescript
let variable: any = 42;
variable = "Now it's a string";
variable = true;
```

While `any` provides flexibility, its usage should be minimized because it removes the benefits of type safety.

---

## **8. Void**

The `void` type represents the absence of any type. It is typically used as the return type of functions that do not return a value.

### Example:

```typescript
function logMessage(message: string): void {
  console.log(message);
}
```

A function with a `void` return type cannot return any value.

---

## **9. Null and Undefined**

In TypeScript, `null` and `undefined` are their own types. By default, `null` and `undefined` are subtypes of all other types, which means you can assign them to any type. However, with the `--strictNullChecks` flag, `null` and `undefined` can only be assigned to their respective types or `any`.

### Example:

```typescript
let n: null = null;
let u: undefined = undefined;
```

With `--strictNullChecks`, you need to explicitly allow `null` or `undefined` by using union types:

```typescript
let nullableString: string | null = null;
let optionalNumber: number | undefined = undefined;
```

---

## **10. Never**

The `never` type represents the type of values that never occur. This is used for functions that always throw errors or functions that never return (e.g., infinite loops).

### Example:

```typescript
function throwError(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message);
}

function infiniteLoop(): never {
  while (true) {}
}
```

A function with a `never` return type either throws an error or never finishes executing.

---

## **11. Object**

The `object` type represents any non-primitive type (i.e., anything that is not `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, or `undefined`).

### Example:

```typescript
let person: object = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
```

However, if you want to access properties of an object, it's better to use a more specific type annotation, like an interface or a type alias.

---

## **12. Union Types**

Union types allow a value to be one of several types. You define a union type using the `|` symbol.

### Example:

```typescript
let id: number | string;
id = 101;         // OK
id = "ABC123";    // OK
```

Union types are useful when a value can have multiple forms.

---

## **13. Type Aliases**

Type aliases allow you to create a custom name for a type. This is particularly useful for complex types.

### Example:

```typescript
type StringOrNumber = string | number;

let value: StringOrNumber;
value = "Hello";  // OK
value = 42;       // OK
```

Type aliases can also be used for more complex object types.

---

## **14. Literal Types**

Literal types allow a variable to be restricted to specific literal values, providing a more precise type definition.

### Example:

```typescript
let direction: "up" | "down" | "left" | "right";
direction = "up";   // OK
// direction = "forward"; // Error: Type '"forward"' is not assignable to type '"up" | "down" | "left" | "right"'
```

Literal types can be combined with union types to create more specific types.

---

## **15. Type Inference**

In TypeScript, if you don’t provide an explicit type annotation, TypeScript will try to **infer** the type based on the value. While it’s good practice to explicitly define types, TypeScript’s type inference works well for simple cases.

### Example:

```typescript
let inferredString = "Hello";  // TypeScript infers that this is a string
let inferredNumber = 42;       // TypeScript infers that this is a number
```

In these cases, TypeScript can infer the types based on the assigned values.

---

## **Summary**

Here’s a quick overview of the basic types in TypeScript:

- **`number`**: For all numeric values (integers, floats, hex, binary, octal).
- **`string`**: For textual data.
- **`boolean`**: For logical true/false values.
- **`array`**: For lists of values, either as `type[]` or `Array<type>`.
- **`tuple`**: For arrays with fixed types and lengths.
- **`enum`**: For a set of named constants (either numeric or string-based).
- **`any`**: For disabling type checking on a variable.
- **`void`**: For functions that don’t return anything.
- **`null` and `undefined`**: For the absence of a value.
- **`never`**: For functions that never return or always throw an error.
- **`object`**: For non-primitive types (objects, arrays, etc.).
- **`union types`**: For values that can be one of several types.
- **`type aliases`**: For defining custom types.
- **`literal types`**: For restricting values to specific literals.

Understanding and utilizing these basic types ensures that your TypeScript code is type-safe, maintainable, and less prone to runtime errors.
