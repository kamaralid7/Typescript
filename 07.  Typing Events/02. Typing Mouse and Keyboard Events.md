Typing **mouse** and **keyboard** events in React with TypeScript is essential for ensuring type safety when handling user interactions. React provides specific types, such as `React.MouseEvent` and `React.KeyboardEvent`, which are used to type event handlers for mouse and keyboard interactions.

Let's explore how to correctly type mouse and keyboard events in React using TypeScript.

---

### 1. **Typing Mouse Events**

Mouse events in React include common actions like clicking, double-clicking, mouse movements, and more. You can type mouse events using `React.MouseEvent<T>`, where `T` is the type of the HTML element that triggers the event (e.g., `HTMLButtonElement`, `HTMLDivElement`, etc.).

#### Example: Typing `onClick` Event for a Button

```tsx
import React from 'react';

const ButtonComponent = () => {
  const handleClick = (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => {
    console.log("Button clicked", event.clientX, event.clientY); // Mouse position
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
  );
};
```

#### Key Points:
- **`React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>`**: This type ensures that the event comes from a button (`HTMLButtonElement`). TypeScript will check that the event handler works with the button element.
- **`event.clientX`, `event.clientY`**: These properties return the mouse position when the click event occurs.

#### Other Mouse Events:
You can handle other mouse events, such as `onDoubleClick`, `onMouseEnter`, and `onMouseLeave`, in a similar way.

##### Example: Typing `onDoubleClick` for a Div

```tsx
const DivComponent = () => {
  const handleDoubleClick = (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
    console.log("Div double-clicked");
  };

  return <div onDoubleClick={handleDoubleClick}>Double-click this div</div>;
};
```

- **`React.MouseEvent<HTMLDivElement>`**: Ensures the event comes from a `div` element. The event handler will only trigger for double clicks.

##### Mouse Event Properties:

Here are some useful properties available on mouse events:
- **`event.clientX`**: The X-coordinate of the mouse pointer in the viewport.
- **`event.clientY`**: The Y-coordinate of the mouse pointer in the viewport.
- **`event.button`**: The mouse button that was clicked (0 for left button, 1 for middle button, 2 for right button).
- **`event.altKey`**, **`event.ctrlKey`**, **`event.shiftKey`**: Boolean flags indicating if modifier keys were pressed during the event.

### 2. **Typing Keyboard Events**

Keyboard events are triggered when keys are pressed or released. You can type keyboard events using `React.KeyboardEvent<T>`, where `T` is the type of the HTML element that triggers the event (e.g., `HTMLInputElement`, `HTMLTextAreaElement`, etc.).

#### Example: Typing `onKeyDown` for an Input

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const InputComponent = () => {
  const [key, setKey] = useState<string>("");

  const handleKeyDown = (event: React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setKey(event.key); // Capture the key pressed
    console.log(`Key pressed: ${event.key}`);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" onKeyDown={handleKeyDown} />
      <p>Last key pressed: {key}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Key Points:
- **`React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>`**: This type ensures that the event comes from an `input` element. It gives you access to keyboard event properties like `event.key`, which represents the key pressed.
- **`event.key`**: This property provides the value of the key pressed, which can be letters, numbers, or special keys like "Enter", "Escape", etc.

#### Other Keyboard Events:
You can handle other keyboard events, such as `onKeyUp` and `onKeyPress`, similarly.

##### Example: Typing `onKeyUp`

```tsx
const handleKeyUp = (event: React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>) => {
  console.log(`Key released: ${event.key}`);
};

<textarea onKeyUp={handleKeyUp}></textarea>;
```

- **`React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>`**: Ensures the event comes from a `textarea` element, which reacts to key releases.

##### Keyboard Event Properties:

Here are some useful properties available on keyboard events:
- **`event.key`**: The value of the key pressed (e.g., "Enter", "Escape", "a", "1").
- **`event.code`**: The physical key code, which is the location of the key on the keyboard (e.g., "KeyA", "Digit1").
- **`event.altKey`**, **`event.ctrlKey`**, **`event.shiftKey`**, **`event.metaKey`**: Boolean flags indicating if modifier keys (Alt, Ctrl, Shift, Meta) were pressed during the event.

### 3. **Typing Combined Mouse and Keyboard Events**

In some scenarios, you may want to combine mouse and keyboard events. For example, you might want to handle a keyboard shortcut while a mouse button is pressed.

#### Example: Combined Mouse and Keyboard Events

```tsx
import React from 'react';

const ComboEventComponent = () => {
  const handleClick = (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
    if (event.altKey) {
      console.log("Alt key and mouse click detected");
    }
  };

  const handleKeyDown = (event: React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLDivElement>) => {
    if (event.ctrlKey && event.key === "s") {
      event.preventDefault(); // Prevent the default Save action (Ctrl + S)
      console.log("Ctrl + S detected");
    }
  };

  return (
    <div onClick={handleClick} onKeyDown={handleKeyDown} tabIndex={0}>
      Click or press Ctrl+S on this div
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Key Points:
- **`event.altKey`** and **`event.ctrlKey`**: These properties can be used to detect whether modifier keys (Alt, Ctrl) were pressed during mouse or keyboard events.
- **`event.preventDefault()`**: You can prevent the default behavior of a keyboard shortcut, like "Ctrl+S" for saving, by calling `preventDefault()`.

### 4. **Typing Custom Components with Mouse and Keyboard Events**

When you create custom components, you may need to define props that expect mouse or keyboard event handlers.

#### Example: Custom Button with Mouse Events

```tsx
import React from 'react';

interface CustomButtonProps {
  onClick: (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => void;
}

const CustomButton: React.FC<CustomButtonProps> = ({ onClick, children }) => {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{children}</button>;
};

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const handleClick = (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => {
    console.log("Custom button clicked");
  };

  return <CustomButton onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</CustomButton>;
};
```

#### Key Points:
- **Custom Event Props**: You can pass the correct event type (`React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>`) as a prop to ensure type safety when handling events in custom components.
- This approach works for both mouse and keyboard events when creating reusable components.

### 5. **Common Event Types Reference**

Here is a quick reference for typing mouse and keyboard events in React with TypeScript:

| **Event**             | **Event Type**                                    | **Element Example**             |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `onClick`             | `React.MouseEvent<T>`                             | `HTMLButtonElement`, `HTMLDivElement` |
| `onDoubleClick`       | `React.MouseEvent<T>`                             | `HTMLDivElement`                |
| `onMouseEnter`, `onMouseLeave` | `React.MouseEvent<T>`                             | `HTMLDivElement`, `HTMLImageElement` |
| `onKeyDown`, `onKeyUp`| `React.KeyboardEvent<T>`                          | `HTMLInputElement`, `HTMLTextAreaElement` |
| `onMouseMove`         | `React.MouseEvent<T>`                             | `HTMLCanvasElement`, `HTMLDivElement` |
| `onContextMenu`       | `React.MouseEvent<T>`                             | `HTMLDivElement`, `HTMLTableElement` |

---

### Summary

- **Mouse Events**: Use `React.MouseEvent<T>` to type mouse events like `onClick`, `onDoubleClick`, `onMouseEnter`, etc., where `T` is the specific HTML element (e.g., `HTMLButtonElement`, `HTMLDivElement`).
- **Keyboard Events**: Use `React.KeyboardEvent<T>` to type keyboard events like `onKeyDown`, `onKeyUp`, and `onKeyPress`. You can access useful properties like `event.key` to determine which key was pressed.
- **Custom Components**: You can pass event handler types as props when creating custom components to ensure type-safe handling of mouse and keyboard events.

Typing mouse and keyboard events in React with TypeScript ensures type safety, prevents runtime errors, and enhances code clarity.
