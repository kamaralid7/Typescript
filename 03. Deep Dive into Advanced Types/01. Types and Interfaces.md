In TypeScript, both `types` and `interfaces` are used to define the shapes of data. While they are often interchangeable, there are subtle differences in how they are used and the features they offer.

## Differences Between `type` and `interface`

### 1. **Declaration**
- `interface`: This is a way to define the structure of an object. It's more commonly used in traditional object-oriented programming and is particularly useful when you want to define contracts for classes.

    ```typescript
    interface Person {
      name: string;
      age: number;
    }
    ```

- `type`: This is more versatile, as it can be used not just for objects, but also for unions, tuples, and other more complex type definitions.

    ```typescript
    type Person = {
      name: string;
      age: number;
    };
    ```

### 2. **Extension (Inheritance)**
- `interface`: Supports extending (or inheriting) other interfaces. This is useful when you want to combine multiple structures into one.
  
    ```typescript
    interface Person {
      name: string;
      age: number;
    }

    interface Employee extends Person {
      salary: number;
    }
    ```

- `type`: You can also create new types by intersecting multiple types, but it uses intersection types (`&`).
  
    ```typescript
    type Person = {
      name: string;
      age: number;
    };

    type Employee = Person & {
      salary: number;
    };
    ```

### 3. **Merging**
- `interface`: Interfaces can be **merged** automatically if two interfaces share the same name. This allows incremental declaration, which can be useful in certain scenarios.
  
    ```typescript
    interface Animal {
      name: string;
    }

    interface Animal {
      age: number;
    }

    // The final Animal interface will have both `name` and `age` properties.
    const dog: Animal = { name: "Dog", age: 5 };
    ```

- `type`: Type aliases cannot be merged. If you try to declare a type with the same name twice, it will result in an error.

    ```typescript
    type Animal = {
      name: string;
    };

    type Animal = {
      age: number; // Error: Duplicate identifier 'Animal'
    };
    ```

### 4. **Complex Types**
- `type`: More powerful when working with complex or non-object types such as unions, tuples, and primitives.

    ```typescript
    type StringOrNumber = string | number;

    type Tuple = [number, string];
    ```

- `interface`: Primarily used for defining object types or contracts, so it cannot define unions or other non-object types directly.

### 5. **Function Signatures**
Both `type` and `interface` can define function signatures, but the syntax differs slightly.

- **Function in `type`**:

    ```typescript
    type Greet = (name: string) => string;

    const greet: Greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}`;
    ```

- **Function in `interface`**:

    ```typescript
    interface Greet {
      (name: string): string;
    }

    const greet: Greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}`;
    ```

### 6. **Utility Types**
- `type`: Type aliases are better suited for utility types, such as `Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`, etc., which are often used to create modified types.

    ```typescript
    type Person = {
      name: string;
      age: number;
      address: string;
    };

    type PartialPerson = Partial<Person>;  // All properties are optional
    ```

## Using Types and Interfaces for Objects, Arrays, and Functions

### Objects
Both types and interfaces can describe objects with specific properties.

- **Using Interface**:
    ```typescript
    interface Car {
      make: string;
      model: string;
      year: number;
    }
    
    const myCar: Car = { make: "Toyota", model: "Camry", year: 2021 };
    ```

- **Using Type**:
    ```typescript
    type Car = {
      make: string;
      model: string;
      year: number;
    };
    
    const myCar: Car = { make: "Toyota", model: "Camry", year: 2021 };
    ```

### Arrays
You can describe the types of elements in an array using either approach.

- **Array of Objects (Interface)**:
    ```typescript
    interface Product {
      name: string;
      price: number;
    }

    const products: Product[] = [
      { name: "Laptop", price: 1000 },
      { name: "Phone", price: 500 }
    ];
    ```

- **Array of Objects (Type)**:
    ```typescript
    type Product = {
      name: string;
      price: number;
    };

    const products: Product[] = [
      { name: "Laptop", price: 1000 },
      { name: "Phone", price: 500 }
    ];
    ```

### Functions
You can describe the structure of functions using both types and interfaces.

- **Function Type**:
    ```typescript
    type Add = (a: number, b: number) => number;

    const add: Add = (a, b) => a + b;
    ```

- **Function Interface**:
    ```typescript
    interface Add {
      (a: number, b: number): number;
    }

    const add: Add = (a, b) => a + b;
    ```

## When to Use `type` vs `interface`

1. **Use `interface`**:
   - When you expect to extend or merge types (especially for class-based designs).
   - When defining the shape of objects, especially when working with object-oriented patterns.
   - When you want to benefit from automatic interface merging (e.g., adding properties to an interface incrementally).

2. **Use `type`**:
   - When defining more complex types like unions, intersections, or tuples.
   - When working with utility types (e.g., `Partial`, `Omit`, `Pick`).
   - When you need more flexibility in defining types beyond object shapes.

In general, `interface` is often the preferred way to define object types in TypeScript, especially in class-based code. However, `type` is more powerful and flexible for broader use cases where objects, functions, arrays, unions, or utility types are involved.
