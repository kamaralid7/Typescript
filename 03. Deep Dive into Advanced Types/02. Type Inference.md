TypeScript has powerful type inference capabilities, which means it can often deduce the type of a variable, function, or expression without needing explicit type annotations. However, in some cases, you may need to manually annotate types to avoid ambiguity, ensure clarity, or handle more complex scenarios.

### How TypeScript Infers Types Automatically

1. **Variable Inference**
   When you assign a value to a variable, TypeScript infers its type based on the initial value.

   ```typescript
   let message = "Hello, TypeScript!";
   // TypeScript infers `message` as a string
   ```

   In this example, TypeScript infers the type of `message` as `string` because it is initialized with a string value. After this, you cannot assign a non-string value to `message`.

2. **Function Return Types**
   TypeScript automatically infers the return type of a function based on its return statements.

   ```typescript
   function add(a: number, b: number) {
     return a + b;
   }
   // Return type is inferred as `number`
   ```

   Here, TypeScript infers that the return type of `add` is `number` because both `a` and `b` are numbers and the function returns their sum.

3. **Array Inference**
   When you create an array, TypeScript infers the type of its elements.

   ```typescript
   let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
   // TypeScript infers `numbers` as `number[]`
   ```

   In this case, TypeScript infers that `numbers` is an array of numbers (`number[]`).

4. **Contextual Typing**
   TypeScript can infer types based on the context in which a value is used. For example, when passing a callback function to another function, TypeScript can infer the types of parameters from the function signature.

   ```typescript
   const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
   numbers.forEach((num) => console.log(num));
   // TypeScript infers `num` as `number` from the array type
   ```

   Here, TypeScript knows that `numbers` is an array of `number`, so it infers the type of `num` in the `forEach` callback as `number`.

5. **Destructuring Inference**
   TypeScript infers types in destructured assignments as well.

   ```typescript
   const person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
   const { name, age } = person;
   // TypeScript infers `name` as `string` and `age` as `number`
   ```

### When to Annotate Types Manually

Even though TypeScript's inference is robust, there are times when manually annotating types is necessary or beneficial:

1. **Function Parameters**
   TypeScript does not infer the types of function parameters by default, so it's good practice to annotate them explicitly. This provides clarity and prevents type-related issues inside the function.

   ```typescript
   function greet(name: string) {
     return `Hello, ${name}`;
   }
   ```

   Here, we explicitly annotate `name` as a `string` to avoid potential issues.

2. **Complex Function Return Types**
   In simple cases, TypeScript can infer the return type of a function, but for more complex functions (e.g., with conditional logic or recursion), you may want to manually annotate the return type to make the function's behavior clearer.

   ```typescript
   function getLength(input: string | string[]): number {
     if (typeof input === "string") {
       return input.length;
     } else {
       return input.length;
     }
   }
   ```

   Here, although TypeScript can infer the return type, adding an explicit return type (`number`) clarifies the intent.

3. **Explicitly Typing Variables**
   Sometimes you may want to declare a variable without initializing it. In such cases, TypeScript cannot infer the type, so you need to annotate it manually.

   ```typescript
   let isActive: boolean;
   isActive = true;
   ```

   Without an initial value, TypeScript doesn’t know what type `isActive` should be, so we need to specify that it’s a `boolean`.

4. **Object and Function Types**
   When creating objects with more complex structures or using functions as types, it’s helpful to explicitly define the type of the object or function.

   ```typescript
   type User = {
     name: string;
     age: number;
   };

   let user: User = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
   ```

   In this example, using a custom `User` type provides clear structure for the `user` object.

5. **Union Types**
   If a variable can have more than one type, you may need to annotate it with a union type, as TypeScript won't always infer complex unions.

   ```typescript
   let value: string | number;
   value = "Hello";
   value = 42;
   ```

6. **Generics**
   For more complex, reusable structures, you may need to explicitly annotate types using generics. This ensures that types are inferred correctly across different uses of the same structure.

   ```typescript
   function identity<T>(value: T): T {
     return value;
   }

   let result = identity<number>(42);
   // `T` is explicitly set to `number`
   ```

### When TypeScript Cannot Infer Types

There are scenarios where TypeScript's inference might not work as expected, and manual annotation is required:

1. **Default Initialization**
   If you define a variable without assigning it an initial value, TypeScript will infer its type as `any` unless you manually annotate it.

   ```typescript
   let result; // TypeScript infers `any`
   result = "hello"; // Now it becomes a string
   ```

2. **Multiple Return Paths**
   In functions with multiple return paths or complex logic, TypeScript might struggle to infer the correct return type. You can avoid ambiguity by explicitly specifying the return type.

   ```typescript
   function processValue(input: string | number) {
     if (typeof input === "string") {
       return input.toUpperCase(); // string
     } else {
       return input * 2; // number
     }
   }
   // TypeScript infers return type as `string | number`, which may not be ideal.
   ```

3. **Type Narrowing for Unions**
   If you have a union of types (e.g., `string | number`) and you're performing operations that depend on one of the types, you may need to explicitly narrow the type using type guards like `typeof` or manual annotations.

   ```typescript
   function process(input: string | number): string {
     if (typeof input === "number") {
       return input.toString(); // Narrow to number
     }
     return input; // input is a string here
   }
   ```

### Best Practices for Type Inference and Annotation

- **Use inference where it provides clarity**: For simple variables and functions, rely on TypeScript's inference to keep your code concise.
  
- **Annotate when necessary**: For function parameters, complex return types, and variables that are declared without initialization, use manual annotations to make the code clearer and avoid implicit `any` types.

- **Use type guards**: When working with unions or complex types, use type guards (`typeof`, `instanceof`, etc.) to narrow down the type and help TypeScript's inference system.

- **Prefer explicit types in public APIs**: When defining public-facing functions or libraries, it’s a good practice to annotate the types explicitly, as it makes the code more predictable and easier for others to use.

In summary, TypeScript’s type inference system is robust and works well for many common scenarios. However, there are times when manual annotations are necessary to provide more clarity, avoid implicit `any` types, or handle more complex logic. A good balance between inference and manual annotation ensures clear, maintainable, and predictable TypeScript code.
