### Union Types and Intersection Types in TypeScript

Union types and intersection types are powerful tools in TypeScript that allow you to create more flexible and robust types. Understanding how to use them will help you write more versatile and type-safe code.

---

## 1. **Union Types (`|`)**

A **union type** allows a value to be one of several types. When you define a union type, you're saying that a variable can hold **any one** of the types in the union.

### Syntax:
```typescript
type A = string | number;
```

This means that `A` can be either a `string` or a `number`.

### Example of Union Types

```typescript
type ID = string | number;

let userId: ID;
userId = "abc123";  // valid, it's a string
userId = 123;       // valid, it's a number
```

### Usage of Union Types

#### a) **Function Parameters with Union Types**
Union types are useful when a function can accept multiple types of arguments.

```typescript
function printId(id: string | number) {
  console.log(`ID: ${id}`);
}

printId(123);      // valid
printId("abc123"); // valid
```

#### b) **Type Narrowing**
To handle different types in a union type, you'll often use **type narrowing**. Type narrowing involves checking the type of the variable at runtime to decide what to do with it.

```typescript
function processId(id: string | number) {
  if (typeof id === "string") {
    // TypeScript knows `id` is a string here
    console.log(id.toUpperCase());
  } else {
    // TypeScript knows `id` is a number here
    console.log(id * 2);
  }
}

processId("abc");  // "ABC"
processId(10);     // 20
```

#### c) **Array of Union Types**
You can also create arrays that accept multiple types of values.

```typescript
let mixedArray: (string | number)[] = [1, "two", 3, "four"];
```

## 2. **Intersection Types (`&`)**

An **intersection type** combines multiple types into **one**, meaning a value must satisfy **all** of the types in the intersection.

### Syntax:
```typescript
type A = { name: string };
type B = { age: number };
type C = A & B;
```

This creates a new type `C` that requires both `name` (from `A`) and `age` (from `B`).

### Example of Intersection Types

```typescript
type Person = { name: string };
type Employee = Person & { id: number };

const employee: Employee = {
  name: "John",
  id: 123,
};
```

In this example, the `employee` object must have both the `name` property (from `Person`) and the `id` property (from `Employee`).

### Usage of Intersection Types

#### a) **Combining Object Types**
Intersection types are useful when you want to combine several types into one cohesive type.

```typescript
type ContactInfo = {
  email: string;
  phone: string;
};

type Address = {
  city: string;
  zip: number;
};

type FullContact = ContactInfo & Address;

const contact: FullContact = {
  email: "john@example.com",
  phone: "123-456-7890",
  city: "New York",
  zip: 10001,
};
```

Here, `contact` must have all the properties from both `ContactInfo` and `Address`.

#### b) **Combining Interfaces**
Intersection types are especially useful when you want to merge multiple interfaces or types into one.

```typescript
interface User {
  username: string;
}

interface Admin {
  adminLevel: number;
}

type AdminUser = User & Admin;

const adminUser: AdminUser = {
  username: "admin123",
  adminLevel: 2,
};
```

In this example, the `AdminUser` type is an intersection of both `User` and `Admin`, meaning the `adminUser` object must have both `username` and `adminLevel`.

---

## 3. **Using Union and Intersection Types Together**

You can combine union and intersection types to create even more complex types. This allows you to build types that handle multiple use cases.

### Example:
```typescript
type ID = string | number;
type Entity = { id: ID } & { createdAt: Date };

const userEntity: Entity = {
  id: "user123",
  createdAt: new Date(),
};
```

Here, `Entity` is an intersection of two types:
- One part requires an `id` that can be either a string or a number (a **union type**).
- The other part requires a `createdAt` field that is a `Date`.

### Complex Example with Union and Intersection Types

```typescript
type ErrorResponse = { error: string };
type SuccessResponse = { data: string };
type Response = ErrorResponse | SuccessResponse;

type Auth = { token: string };
type ApiResponse = Auth & Response;

const successResponse: ApiResponse = {
  token: "abc123",
  data: "User data loaded successfully",
};

const errorResponse: ApiResponse = {
  token: "abc123",
  error: "Failed to load user data",
};
```

In this example:
- `ApiResponse` is an intersection of `Auth` and `Response`.
- `Response` is a **union type**, so it can be either `ErrorResponse` or `SuccessResponse`.
- The `ApiResponse` type must have a `token` (from `Auth`) and either `error` or `data` (from `Response`).

### When to Use Union and Intersection Types

- **Use Union Types (`|`)**:
  - When you want a value to be **one of several possible types**.
  - For example, when a function can accept multiple types of input, such as `string | number`, and you want to handle each case appropriately.

- **Use Intersection Types (`&`)**:
  - When you want a value to satisfy **all** of the types in the intersection.
  - For example, when combining objects or interfaces, such as `Person & Address`, where the final type requires both the properties of `Person` and `Address`.

### Conclusion

- **Union types** (`|`) are great when you want to allow **either one type or another** (e.g., `string | number`).
- **Intersection types** (`&`) are useful when you want to **combine multiple types** into one type that satisfies all conditions (e.g., combining properties from different interfaces).

These two concepts are key tools in TypeScript for building flexible and robust type systems that adapt to different scenarios, making your code more scalable and maintainable.
